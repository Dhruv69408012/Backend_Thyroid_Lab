Primary hypothyroidism is a disorder marked by 
insufficient production of thyroid hormones (thyroxine 
(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)), stemming from 
dysfunction or damage to the thyroid gland. Autoimmune 
thyroiditis, like Hashimoto's, is a common cause, where 
the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid tissue.
Other causes include thyroid surgery, radiation therapy,
certain medications, and iodine deficiency. In primary 
hypothyroidism, the thyroid fails to produce enough 
hormones, disrupting metabolic processes. Symptoms include
fatigue, weight gain, cold sensitivity, dry skin, 
constipation, depression, and impaired concentration.
Diagnosis involves blood tests measuring thyroid hormone
levels (T4, T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). 
Treatment involves lifelong thyroid hormone
replacement therapy, often with synthetic levothyroxine, 
to restore hormone levels and alleviate symptoms.
Regular monitoring and medication adjustments are crucial 
for optimal thyroid function. Untreated, primary 
hypothyroidism can lead to cardiovascular issues, 
infertility, and neurological problems. Consultation with a 
healthcare professional is vital for accurate diagnosis and 
personalized management.
